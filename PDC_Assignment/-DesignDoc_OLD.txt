Knowledge repository of census data

A Data repository is stored in data for this program. 
In it are sub folders for various csv and text files, and an accessed.txt file 
that records how often a file is accessed.

Features:
SEARCH: Search for a file name. 
            If a direct match is found, print it's contents. Increase it's priority by 1
            If no direct matches are found, print partial matches
ADD: Receive a filepath, and copy that file into a folder designated from the user.
REMOVE: Remove a file that exists in the data repository
WRITE: Add a line of text to any file in the data repository


Other Specs:
 - Any input is checked if it is '0' or 'x'. If this is ever received, the program
is terminated.
 - Folder names and file names are loaded into memory at startup. 
 - File contents are loaded as needed.

 - There is a layer of abstraction between input/output and logic handling
 - Generally speaking, filehandler and clihandler handles logic in most cases
 - filereadhandler, filewritehandler, and clinterface handles actual
    input/output to/from files
