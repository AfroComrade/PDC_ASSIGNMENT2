JDK version:
openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20

NetBeans version:
Apache NetBeans IDE 12.4

 - Make a simple GUI that shows a table
 - Make a DB that can create tables from CSV imports

Likely changed
 - Care less about how often accessed (less needed if we can see a list of tables)



CSV IMPORT:
 - Use a string tokenizer? We need to separate ONLY the commas outside of the strings
 - Everything inside of a string should be input into a string variable and added to the table

DATABASE:
 - Not touching GUI
 - Create and import tables for each CSV
 - Separate import function for new CSVS
 - Update function to add a line
 - Delete function to delete a table (and csv)

 - Derby Embedded?
 - Make sure program can start and connect without starting Db service

GUI
 - JList showing each table (with csv name)
 - Some sort of JTable that displays the selected table?
 - Import, update, delete buttons
